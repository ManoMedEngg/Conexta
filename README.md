    -   High-visibility visual design with white text and gold highlights for selected items.
-   **Patient View**:
    -   Live ECG waveform animation.
    -   Personalized health timeline (Morning/Afternoon/Night).
    -   Prescriptions and Health Tips.
-   **Engineer Panel**:
    -   Device inventory management.
    -   Maintenance alerts (AMC expiring, Calibration due).
    -   Device status monitoring (Online/Offline/Attention).

### 2. Comprehensive Internationalization (i18n)
Full translation support for **9 languages**:

-   **Responsive Layout**: Adapts seamlessly to tablets and desktop screens.

## Tech Stack
-   **Core**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
-   **Styling**: Custom CSS variables for theming, Flexbox/Grid layouts.
-   **No Framework Build**: Lightweight, fast-loading, and no complex build steps required.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MedEngger/Conexta.git
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`**:
    Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No local server or build process is strictly necessary for the demo features, though a local server (e.g., Live Server) is recommended for best performance with routing.

## Project Structure
-   `index.html`: Main entry point and app shell.
-   `styles/`: 
    -   `main.css`: Core variables and base styles.
    -   `animations.css`: Keyframe animations and transitions.
-   `js/`:
